  <p>Our dining is on a first come, first served basis. However, if you have a large party, are planning an event, or need catering services, drop us a line and we'll hook you up.</p>
  <p>We're located in the heart of old town. Centrally located, you can easily get to us from any area in the valley. Here's a map, but if you get lost, just give us a call and we'll tell you how to get here.</p>

  <h1 id="story-title">Our Story</h1>
  <p>Memphis is the home of soul music, soul food, and fried chicken. While we did not invent the chicken wing, we did make it better!</p>
  <p>We identified a gap in the "4th meal" segment (you know, the late-night, cramming-for-a-test munchies), and we needed food to absorb all of that knowledge! And thus, South Mouth was born.</p>
  <p>While "cramming" for said test it may not always be safe to drive to a late night destination for great food or sometimes you just look up and it's closing time (time to close the books of course).  That is why we offer late night delivery up to 3:00 am.</p>
  <p>All of our sauces, dry rubs, and dipping sauces are made in house every day. We also offer appetizers, some sweet desserts, and a few awesome sandwiches. Chocolate Salty Balls are a homage to Boulder and Memphis. The name comes from an episode of South Park; these double chocolate fudge brownie bites are kissed with sea salt and the perfect complement to a late-night "study session".</p>
