        <p>Food, Friends and Fun!  Memphis is the home of soul music, soul food and most importantly fried chicken.  While we did not launch the chicken wing but we did make it better!</p>
        <p>As college kids we identified a gap in the "4th meal" segment (you know, the late night, um... cramming for a test, yeah thats it!) when we needed food to absorb all of that... um, knowledge, yeah!</p>
        <p>In college we didn't want the same ol' food from a convenience store or another pizza place, we wanted variety and we needed great, flavorful food!</p>
        <p>So, in an effort to offer delicious, scratch style, home cooked food (with a college budget in mind) and the convenience of late night delivery and some southern hospitality and charm, South Mouth was born!</p>
        <p>While "cramming" for said test it may not always be safe to drive to a late night destination for great food or sometimes you just look up and it's closing time (time to close the books of course).  That is why we offer late night delivery up to 3:00 am.</p>
        <p>From our Memphis roots we bring you the flavors we grew up with.  We have over 19 unique flavors of wet, dry and crunch style wings and limitless possibilities for making up your own combinations and flavors... our favorite is the "dirty bird" (ask one our wingmen when ordering to get the scoop in the coop).  We also offer amazing homemade jumbo mozzarella cheese sticks, our favorite appetizers and a few awesome sandwiches.</p>
        <p>We offer some sweets as well.   Our favorite are the "Chocolate Salty Balls".  An hommage to Boulder and Memphis. The name comes from an episode of South Park.  These fried double chocolate fudge cookie bites are kissed with sea salt and the perfect compliment for a late night "study session".  Isaac Hayes (the voice of Chef from South Park) was a Memphis legend and Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creative minds behind South Park) met while attending CU and thus the perfect pairing for the apropos marriage of Boulder and Memphis!  "put em' in yo mouth!"</p>
